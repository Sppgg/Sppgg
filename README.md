# 👩‍💻 Hey, I’m Sara!

Front-end developer • Creative problem-solver • Code poet in training

Based in Spain 🌴, I mix clean code with creativity, building user experiences that are not just functional, but delightful. I believe the best tech feels like magic — not because it’s complex, but because it just *works*.

## 💡 What I Love Building

- Interfaces that *feel right*
- Web experiences that connect tech with humans
- Clean, scalable components with purpose
- Accessible, responsive layouts for all screens

> My goal isn’t just to write code — it’s to craft intuitive solutions that feel invisible.
